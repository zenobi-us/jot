# Update README with Semantic Search Features

## Objective
Update the main README.md to include semantic search as a key feature, with brief examples showing keyword vs semantic vs hybrid modes.

## Steps
- [x] Add semantic search to Features list
- [x] Add semantic search examples to Quick Start or Common Commands
- [x] Ensure search mode syntax is documented (--mode flag)
- [x] Add brief explanation of when to use each mode

## Expected Outcome
Users can learn about semantic search capabilities directly from README.md

## Actual Outcome
- Added semantic search to Features list with brief description
- Created dedicated "Semantic Search (Optional)" section with examples
- Documented all three modes (hybrid, keyword, semantic)
- Added --explain flag example
- Linked to detailed documentation

## Lessons Learned
- Keep README examples focused and brief - detailed docs belong in docs/
