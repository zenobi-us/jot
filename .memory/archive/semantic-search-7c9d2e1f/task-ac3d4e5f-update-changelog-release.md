# Update CHANGELOG and Release Notes

## Objective
Prepare CHANGELOG entry documenting the semantic search feature addition for the next release.

## Steps
- [x] Create/update CHANGELOG.md with semantic search feature
- [x] Document new CLI flags (--mode, --explain)
- [x] Note any breaking changes (none expected)
- [x] Add migration notes if any (opt-in feature)

## Expected Outcome
Release notes are ready for the next version release

## Actual Outcome
- Added comprehensive semantic search feature section to CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]
- Documented all three search modes with examples
- Listed key features: RRF merge, boolean filters, explain mode, fallback
- Added usage examples and "when to use" guidance
- Linked to semantic search guide documentation

## Lessons Learned
- Feature documentation in CHANGELOG should be self-contained for users scanning release notes
