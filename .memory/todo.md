## 🎯 ACTIVE EPIC: Getting Started Guide for Power Users

### Epic Overview - RESEARCH COMPLETE, READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION  
**Goal**: Enable power users to import existing markdown and become productive with advanced features in 15 minutes
**Research Status**: ✅ Complete analysis of documentation gaps and competitive landscape
**Epic File**: `epic-b8e5f2d4-getting-started-guide.md`  
**Research File**: `research-d4f8a2c1-getting-started-gaps.md`

### Key Research Discoveries
- **Capability-Documentation Paradox**: Advanced SQL querying hidden behind basic documentation  
- **Import Workflow Missing**: No guidance for existing markdown collections (primary need)
- **Competitive Advantages**: Unique SQL + JSON capabilities not properly showcased
- **Progressive Disclosure Broken**: Large gap between basic and advanced usage

### 📋 PHASE 1: High-Impact Quick Wins (1-2 hours) - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

**Goal**: Address most critical documentation gaps with minimal effort for maximum impact

#### Ready for Implementation Tasks
- **🔥 README Enhancement** - Add import workflow section and SQL demonstration upfront
  - **Impact**: Immediate improvement to first impression for power users
  - **Scope**: Import example, SQL query demo, value proposition positioning
  
- **🔥 CLI Cross-References** - Connect command help to existing documentation
  - **Impact**: Bridge discovery gap between commands and advanced docs  
  - **Scope**: Add --help references to docs/, SQL guide, advanced features

- **🔥 Value Positioning** - Lead with SQL capabilities as primary differentiator
  - **Impact**: Showcase competitive advantages immediately
  - **Scope**: Reframe opening content to highlight unique capabilities

#### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- ✅ Import workflow visible from first interaction
- ✅ SQL capabilities prominently featured  
- ✅ Clear bridges to existing technical documentation
- ✅ Power user value proposition immediately clear

### 🚀 NEXT PHASES: Planned Implementation

#### Phase 2: Core Getting Started Guide (4-6 hours)
- **Import Workflow Guide**: Complete existing markdown integration documentation
- **Linear Progression**: Installation → import → basic SQL → advanced features  
- **SQL Quick Reference**: Bridge basic queries to DuckDB markdown functions
- **Configuration Cookbook**: Power user setup patterns

#### Phase 3: Integration and Polish (2-3 hours)
- **Automation Examples**: jq integration and shell scripting patterns
- **Advanced Gateway**: Clear paths to existing technical documentation
- **Testing**: Validate 15-minute onboarding target achieved
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensure examples work across environments

## Available Work - IMMEDIATE ACTION

### ⚙️ [NEEDS-HUMAN] PHASE 1 ARTIFACT COMPLIANCE FIX (15-20 minutes)
**Status**: Validation Complete - Awaiting Human Confirmation
**Issue**: Phase 1 deliverables created at root level; need to conform to miniproject guidelines
**Details**: 
- 4/5 files in wrong location (should be in `.memory/`)
- 5/6 files use wrong naming convention (missing 8-char hash)
- Frontmatter incomplete (missing id, epic_id, status, updated_at)
- 1 file in .txt format (should be .md)
**Validation Report**: `.memory/validation-phase1-artifacts.md`
**Compliance Summary**: `.memory/phase1-compliance-summary.txt`
**Required Action**:
  - [ ] Move 4 root-level files to `.memory/` directory
  - [ ] Rename all 6 files to follow convention: `.memory/<type>-<hash>-<title>.md`
  - [ ] Add complete frontmatter with id, epic_id, status, updated_at
  - [ ] Convert PHASE1_DELIVERABLES.txt to .md format
  - [ ] Update .memory/summary.md to reference new locations
  - [ ] Commit with: `docs(memory): conform phase1 artifacts to miniproject guidelines`
**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes
**Impact**: Improves compliance from 62% to 95%

### 🔥 PHASE 1 READY FOR IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION

**High-Impact, Low-Effort Tasks Ready Now**:

1. **📝 [TASK-READY] README Enhancement with Import Section**
   - **Duration**: 30-45 minutes
