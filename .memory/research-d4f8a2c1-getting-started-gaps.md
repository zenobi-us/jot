# OpenNotes Getting Started Documentation Gaps - Research Report

**Research Completion**: 2026-01-19 22:21  
**Research Agent**: Deep Research Specialist  
**Focus**: Power user onboarding documentation analysis  
**Target Outcome**: 15-minute value demonstration for experienced developers

## Research Summary

Comprehensive analysis of OpenNotes documentation gaps targeting power user onboarding, including existing documentation inventory, competitive tool analysis, workflow mapping, and specific recommendations for improving user adoption through better getting started guidance.

## Key Findings

### Primary Discovery
OpenNotes exhibits a "capability-documentation paradox"—sophisticated technical capabilities (SQL querying, intelligent auto-discovery, advanced template systems) are hidden behind basic note management documentation, creating significant adoption friction for the target power user segment.

### Critical Gap Analysis
1. **Import Workflow Missing**: No guidance for migrating existing markdown collections
2. **SQL Power Hidden**: Advanced querying capabilities buried in separate technical docs  
3. **Progressive Disclosure Broken**: Large gap between basic commands and advanced features
4. **Workflow Integration Unclear**: No demonstration of tool integration with existing developer workflows

### Competitive Positioning
Analysis of similar tools (ripgrep, fd, GitHub CLI, zk) reveals OpenNotes has unique differentiators (SQL querying, statistical analysis) that provide competitive advantages, but these are invisible in current onboarding experience.

## Strategic Recommendations

### High-Impact Quick Wins
1. **README Enhancement**: Add import section and SQL demonstration
2. **CLI Cross-References**: Connect command help to existing documentation
3. **Value Positioning**: Lead with SQL capabilities immediately

### Core Documentation Development  
1. **Import Workflow Guide**: Step-by-step existing markdown integration
2. **SQL Quick Reference**: Bridge basic search to advanced querying
3. **Configuration Cookbook**: Power user setup patterns

### Implementation Strategy
15-minute onboarding path: Import existing content (5 min) → Configuration and templates (7 min) → Automation examples (3 min)
