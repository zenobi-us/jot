# Getting Started Epic - Documentation Strategy Insights

## Summary

The Getting Started Guide epic successfully addressed the "capability-documentation paradox" by creating comprehensive onboarding documentation that showcases OpenNotes' advanced capabilities upfront. Key insight: power users need to see SQL querying and automation potential in the first 5 minutes, not buried in technical docs.

## Problem Discovery: The Capability-Documentation Paradox

**Core Issue**: OpenNotes possessed advanced SQL querying, JSON output, and automation capabilities, but these were hidden behind basic note-taking documentation.

**Impact**:
- Power users (target audience) couldn't discover competitive advantages
- First impression was "basic note tool" rather than "SQL-powered knowledge system"
- Import workflow missing - no path for existing markdown collections
- Large gap between basic CLI and advanced features

**Root Cause**: Documentation written from implementation perspective, not user journey perspective.

## Strategic Approach: Progressive Value Disclosure

### Phase 1: High-Impact Quick Wins (1h 45min)
**Strategy**: Update existing touchpoints for maximum visibility with minimum effort

**Key Insight**: README and CLI help are the first touchpoints - make them count.

**Implementation**:
1. **README Enhancement** - SQL-first positioning with practical examples
   - Moved SQL capabilities from "Advanced" to "Why OpenNotes?"
   - Added 5-minute quick start showing import → query → automation
   - Included jq integration examples for immediate automation value
   
2. **CLI Cross-References** - Bridge commands to documentation
   - Added 4 documentation links to root command help
   - Each command now explains its advanced features
   - Search command references SQL guide directly
   
3. **Power User Guide** - Comprehensive 15-minute onboarding
   - Part 1: Import (2 min) - Existing markdown integration
   - Part 2: SQL Power (5 min) - 5 practical examples
   - Part 3: Automation (5 min) - JSON + jq patterns
   - Part 4: Workflows (3 min) - Real use cases

**Result**: Import workflow and SQL capabilities now visible from first interaction ✅

### Phase 2: Core Documentation (3h 30min)
**Strategy**: Fill critical gaps with comprehensive, example-driven guides

**Key Insights**:
- Users need concrete examples, not abstract explanations
- Progressive learning levels work better than all-at-once dumps

2. **Troubleshooting Guide** (3,714 words, 25+ solutions)
   - Installation and setup issues
   - Import and migration problems
   - SQL query errors and debugging
   - Performance optimization
   - Common pitfalls with solutions

3. **Documentation INDEX** (2,106 words)
   - Complete navigation guide
   - Learning paths for different use cases
   - Quick reference sections
   - 50+ verified documentation links

**Result**: Complete onboarding ecosystem with safety nets and advanced integration ✅

## Documentation Principles Discovered

### 1. Value-First Structure
**Principle**: Show unique value in first 5 minutes, not buried in advanced sections.

**Application**:
- README: SQL capabilities in "Why OpenNotes?" section
- CLI help: Power user features mentioned first
- Power user guide: SQL examples in Part 2 (5 minutes in)

**Anti-pattern**: "Getting started" → "Basic usage" → "Advanced features" → "SQL" (SQL too late!)

### 2. Progressive Disclosure with Examples
**Principle**: Teach through concrete examples, build complexity gradually.

**Application**:
- SQL Quick Reference: 4 progressive levels
- Each level has 5-6 practical examples
- Examples solve real problems, not abstract demos

**Anti-pattern**: Reference documentation dump without learning path.

### 3. Import Before Create
**Principle**: Power users have existing content - show import first, not greenfield.

**Application**:
- Import workflow front and center
- Migration scenarios from other tools
- Organization patterns for existing collections

**Anti-pattern**: "Create your first note" → "Add more notes" (ignores existing content)

### 4. Automation Gateway
**Principle**: Show integration potential early, provide production-ready scripts.

**Application**:
- jq examples in 5-minute quick start
- Automation recipes with error handling
- Shell integration patterns

**Anti-pattern**: "You can pipe JSON to other tools" without examples.

### 5. Safety Nets
**Principle**: Comprehensive troubleshooting prevents support burden and user frustration.

**Application**:
- 25+ troubleshooting scenarios
- Common pitfalls documented upfront
- Error messages mapped to solutions

**Anti-pattern**: Assume happy path, users debug alone.

```go
// Root command help
Long: `OpenNotes - SQL-powered note management

Quick Start: See docs/getting-started-power-users.md

Documentation:
  - SQL Guide: docs/sql-guide.md
  - Automation: docs/automation-recipes.md
  - Import: docs/import-workflow-guide.md
`,
```

### Example-Driven Teaching Pattern
```markdown
## Task: Find notes by tag

### Example
```bash
opennotes notes search --sql "
  SELECT title, path
  FROM notes
  WHERE frontmatter_extract(content, 'tags') LIKE '%urgent%'
"
```

### Explanation
- Uses `frontmatter_extract()` for YAML parsing
- `LIKE` with wildcards for partial matching
- Returns title and path for context
```

## Implications for Future Projects

### When Creating Documentation
