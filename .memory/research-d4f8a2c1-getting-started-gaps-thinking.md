# OpenNotes Getting Started Documentation Gaps - Research Methodology

## Research Process and Decisions

**Start Time**: 2026-01-19 21:56
**Research Topic**: Documentation gaps for OpenNotes getting started guide targeting power users
**Storage Prefix**: .memory/research-d4f8a2c1-getting-started-gaps

## Approach

### Phase 1: Existing Documentation Inventory (Current)
- Examine all user-facing documentation in the OpenNotes project
- Analyze CLI help system comprehensiveness  
- Review README for getting started guidance
- Assess any existing docs/ directory content
- Evaluate current onboarding flow for power users

### Phase 2: Competitive Analysis 
- Research similar CLI tools popular with developers
- Focus on note-taking, documentation, and developer productivity tools
- Analyze onboarding patterns that achieve 15-minute value demonstration
- Target tools: ripgrep, fd, bat, exa, fzf, hub, gh, jq, etc.

### Phase 3: Workflow Mapping
- Map the complete "import existing markdown" workflow
- Identify decision points and potential failure modes
- Document where users need guidance vs. can self-discover
- Focus on experienced developer mental models

### Phase 4: Gap Analysis & Prioritization
- Cross-reference existing docs against competitive best practices
- Identify high-impact documentation gaps
- Prioritize based on power user needs and quick value demonstration

## Assumptions and Limitations

- Focusing on power users (experienced developers) not beginners
- Targeting 15-minute onboarding time constraint
- Must leverage existing OpenNotes capabilities only
- Emphasizing quick value demonstration over comprehensive tutorials
