# Phase 1 - Research & User Story Discovery

## Overview
Identify casual-user problems that semantic search solves (conceptual topic recall), evaluate feasible technical approaches, and translate findings into candidate user stories.

## Deliverables
- Research synthesis focused on casual-user conceptual search use cases
- Recommended user story set with acceptance criteria drafts
- Technical feasibility notes (index storage, embeddings, latency, privacy)

## Tasks
- TBD: create research tasks and story definition tasks

## Dependencies
- Existing research: chromem-go evaluation notes and vector search synthesis
- Baseline metrics from Bleve search for comparison

## Next Steps
- Define research questions and data sources
- Align on target user personas and primary workflows
- Confirm semantic search accessed via dedicated subcommand with merged hybrid results
