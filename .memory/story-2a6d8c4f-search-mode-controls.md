# Semantic and Keyword Mode Controls

## User Story
As a power user, I want to force semantic-only or keyword-only results so that I can troubleshoot or refine search behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] CLI flags exist to disable either retrieval type.
- [x] A warning is shown if a mode is disabled and no results are found.

## Context
Power users may want to compare retrieval modes during evaluation.

## Out of Scope
- Persisted user preferences.

## Tasks
- [task-5e6f7a8b-mode-controls.md](task-5e6f7a8b-mode-controls.md)

## Notes
- Keep defaults optimized for casual users.
