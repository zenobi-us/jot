# SQL Glob Rooting Issue Research and Analysis

## Summary

Critical security and functionality bug discovered in SQL query handling: glob patterns like `**/*.md` resolve from current working directory instead of notebook root, causing inconsistent results and potential security exposure. Research confirms need for query preprocessing with pattern substitution to ensure proper path resolution.

## Details

### Problem Analysis

**Core Issue**: SQL queries containing file glob patterns (`**/*.md`, `*.md`, etc.) are resolved from the current working directory instead of the notebook root directory.

**Impact Assessment**:
1. **Functional Impact**: Query results vary based on where command is executed within notebook
2. **Security Impact**: Potential access to files outside notebook boundaries
3. **User Experience Impact**: Inconsistent behavior breaks user mental model
4. **Data Integrity Impact**: Same query can return different results based on execution context

### Technical Root Cause

**DuckDB Behavior**: The markdown extension resolves glob patterns relative to the process working directory, not relative to any notebook context.

**Current Implementation Gap**: No preprocessing layer exists to translate user-intended patterns (notebook-relative) to actual filesystem patterns (absolute paths).

**Example Scenarios**:
```sql
-- User executes from notebook root: /notebooks/work/
-- Pattern: **/*.md
-- Resolves to: /notebooks/work/**/*.md ✓ CORRECT

-- User executes from subdirectory: /notebooks/work/projects/
-- Pattern: **/*.md  
-- Resolves to: /notebooks/work/projects/**/*.md ✗ WRONG
```

### Security Analysis

**Vulnerability Type**: Path traversal via glob expansion
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Data leakage potential
**Attack Vector**: Malicious queries could access files outside notebook scope

**Threat Scenarios**:
1. **Accidental Exposure**: User in subdirectory accidentally queries parent directories
2. **Intentional Bypass**: Crafted queries to access files outside notebook
3. **Data Confusion**: Results mixing notebook and non-notebook content

### Solution Architecture

**Pattern Substitution Approach**:
1. **Parse Query**: Identify glob patterns in SQL text
2. **Resolve Notebook Root**: Use existing NotebookService to find notebook base path
3. **Transform Patterns**: Convert relative patterns to absolute paths anchored at notebook root
4. **Execute Modified Query**: Run preprocessed SQL with corrected paths

**Implementation Strategy**:
```go
func preprocessSQL(query string, notebookRoot string) string {
    // Find all quoted strings containing glob patterns
    // Replace with absolute paths from notebook root
    // Return modified query
}
```

### Pattern Detection Strategy

**Regex Approach**: Identify file patterns within SQL strings
- Single-quoted patterns: `'**/*.md'`
- Double-quoted patterns: `"**/*.md"`
- Common patterns: `*.md`, `**/*.md`, `subdirectory/*.md`

**Path Resolution Logic**:
```go
func resolvePattern(pattern, notebookRoot string) string {
    if !isGlobPattern(pattern) {
        return pattern
    }
    return filepath.Join(notebookRoot, pattern)
}
```

### Testing Strategy

**Test Categories**:
1. **Pattern Detection**: Verify regex correctly identifies glob patterns
2. **Path Resolution**: Test pattern conversion to absolute paths
3. **SQL Integration**: Ensure preprocessing doesn't break valid SQL
4. **Security Validation**: Confirm no path traversal vulnerabilities
5. **Edge Cases**: Handle malformed patterns, special characters, etc.

**Test Data Requirements**:
- Sample SQL queries with various glob patterns
- Notebook structures with subdirectories
- Malicious query attempts for security testing

### Performance Considerations

**Preprocessing Overhead**: String manipulation on every SQL query
**Mitigation**: Pattern detection should be efficient (compiled regex)
**Benchmark Target**: <1ms additional latency per query

**Memory Impact**: Minimal - temporary string allocations during preprocessing
**Scalability**: No impact on concurrent query execution

## Implications

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Critical Bug Fix**: Implement preprocessSQL function in DbService
2. **Security Hardening**: Add path traversal protection
3. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing for all pattern types
4. **Documentation Update**: Update SQL help text with pattern behavior

### Long-term Architectural Benefits

1. **Query Preprocessing Framework**: Foundation for future query enhancements
2. **Security Layer**: Centralized point for SQL security validations
3. **User Experience**: Consistent behavior regardless of execution location
4. **Debugging Support**: Ability to log transformed queries for troubleshooting

### Development Workflow Integration

**Quality Gates**:
- All existing SQL tests must pass with preprocessing
- New security tests must validate path traversal protection
- Performance benchmarks must not degrade significantly
- Documentation must clearly explain pattern behavior

**Rollout Strategy**:
- Implement with feature flag for safe rollback
- Comprehensive testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Monitor query performance in production
- Gradual rollout with user feedback collection
