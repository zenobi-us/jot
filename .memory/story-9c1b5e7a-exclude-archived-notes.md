# Exclude Archived or Draft Notes

## User Story
As a casual user, I want to exclude archived or draft notes from results so that I can focus on current work.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can exclude notes by frontmatter status or tags (e.g., status:archived, tag:draft).
- [ ] Exclusions apply to both keyword and semantic results.

## Context
Even in a single notebook, filtering outdated notes reduces noise.

## Out of Scope
- Cross-notebook filtering.

## Tasks
- TBD

## Notes
- Leverage existing query condition syntax where possible.
