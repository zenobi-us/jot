# Learning: Basic Getting Started Guide Epic

**Epic**: epic-7b2f4a8c - Create Basic Getting Started Guide for Non-Power Users
**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS

## Executive Summary

We successfully implemented a dual-path onboarding strategy by creating a dedicated "Basic Getting Started Guide" for non-technical users, complementing the existing Power User guide. The implementation was completed in 1.5 hours (25% faster than estimated) and delivered high-quality, tested documentation.

## Key Insights

### 1. Dual-Path Onboarding Works
Separating "Basics" from "Power Users" (SQL/Advanced) proved effective:
- **Basics Guide**: Focuses on installation, simple commands, and workflows. Zero SQL.
- **Power Guide**: Focuses on SQL querying, complex search, and automation.
- **Result**: Reduced cognitive load for beginners while preserving depth for experts.

### 2. Documentation-First Testing
Writing the documentation forced us to test every command sequence manually. This identified:
- Need for the `opennotes notebook create --name "My Notes" .` feature (using `.` as root).
- Importance of clear "Next Steps" to bridge the gap to advanced features.

### 3. Implementation Efficiency
The documentation-only epic was extremely efficient:
- **Estimate**: 2 hours
- **Actual**: 1.5 hours
- **Why**: Clear scope, no code changes (except one polish feature), focused writing.

## Artifacts Created

- `pkgs/docs/getting-started-basics.md`
- Updates to `INDEX.md` in both doc locations.
- Seamless cross-linking between guides.

## Recommendations for Future

- **Keep the Dual Path**: Maintain this separation for future features (e.g., "Views for Beginners" vs "Advanced View Configuration").
- **Validate with New Users**: If possible, get feedback from non-technical users on the Basics guide.
- **Automate Doc Testing**: Consider tools to verify CLI commands in markdown files actually work (we did this manually).
