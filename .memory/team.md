# OpenNotes Team Status

## Current Session
- **Session ID**: dsl-views-phase6-implplan
- **Status**: Phase 6 complete (implementation plan created)
- **Completed**: [research-b4e2f7a1](research-b4e2f7a1-dsl-based-views-design.md) — All 6 phases ✅
- **Deliverable**: [plan-b4e2f7a1](plan-b4e2f7a1-dsl-views-implementation.md) — 10-task implementation plan

## Epic Assignment
- Active: epic-8361d3a2 (Rename to Jot) — Phase 1 Discovery
- Ready: plan-b4e2f7a1 (DSL Views Implementation) — 10 tasks pending

## Completed Work This Session
1. Read miniproject and writing-plans skills
2. Reviewed research phases 1-5 findings
3. Created comprehensive implementation plan with:
   - 10 TDD tasks (test first, then implement)
   - Exact file paths and code examples
   - Verification steps for each task
   - Incremental commit strategy

## Next Action Options
1. **Execute DSL views plan**: Use `superpowers:executing-plans` to implement 10 tasks
2. **Start rename discovery**: Execute [task-b66d2263](task-b66d2263-identify-rename-locations.md)

## Handoff Notes
- Implementation plan is self-contained — engineer needs zero codebase context
- Each task has failing test → implementation → passing test → commit cycle
- Tasks 1-6 build core infrastructure; Tasks 7-10 integrate and clean up
