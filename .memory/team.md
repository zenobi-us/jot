## Project Current Status

**Session ID**: current-session-20260119  
**Current Epic**: Getting Started Guide for Power Users  
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - High-Impact Quick Wins  
**Epic Status**: ✅ **RESEARCH COMPLETE** - Ready for implementation
**Priority**: High - Address capability-documentation paradox for user adoption  
**Epic Created**: 2026-01-19 20:22 GMT+10:30  
**Research Complete**: 2026-01-19 20:45 GMT+10:30  
**Status**: 🎯 **PHASE 1 READY** - High-impact tasks scoped for immediate implementation

### Current Epic: Getting Started Guide Implementation

**Epic File**: `epic-b8e5f2d4-getting-started-guide.md`  
**Research File**: `research-d4f8a2c1-getting-started-gaps.md`  

**Research Completion Status**: ✅ Comprehensive analysis complete
- **Gap Analysis**: Critical documentation gaps identified and prioritized
- **Competitive Research**: Best practices from similar CLI tools analyzed  
- **User Journey Mapping**: Import workflow completely mapped with friction points
- **Strategic Recommendations**: High-impact improvements identified by effort/impact ratio

**Key Research Findings**:
- **Capability-Documentation Paradox**: Advanced SQL features hidden behind basic docs
- **Import Workflow Gap**: No guidance for existing markdown collections (primary need)
- **Progressive Disclosure Broken**: Large gap between basic and advanced usage
- **Competitive Advantages**: Unique SQL + JSON capabilities not properly showcased

### Phase 1: High-Impact Quick Wins (READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION)
**Target Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**Goal**: Address most critical gaps with minimal effort for maximum user experience improvement

**Ready Tasks**:
1. **README Enhancement** - Add import workflow and SQL demonstration upfront (30-45 min)
2. **CLI Cross-References** - Connect command help to existing documentation (30 min)  
3. **Value Positioning** - Highlight SQL capabilities as primary differentiator (20-30 min)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Import workflow visible from first user interaction
- ✅ SQL capabilities prominently featured in opening content
- ✅ Clear bridges between CLI commands and advanced documentation
- ✅ Power user value proposition immediately apparent

### Planned Phases
**Phase 2**: Core Getting Started Guide (4-6 hours) - Comprehensive documentation  
**Phase 3**: Integration and Polish (2-3 hours) - Automation examples and testing

## Previous Epic Completion

### SQL JSON Output Implementation Epic - ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
**Duration**: 6 tasks across 3 phases  
**Achievement**: Production-ready JSON output with comprehensive automation integration  
**Status**: Ready for archival after human review

**Final Results**:
- ✅ **All Success Criteria Exceeded**: JSON output, type conversion, automation integration
- ✅ **Zero Regressions**: 339+ existing tests continue passing
- ✅ **User Value**: Clean JSON objects replace ugly Go map formatting  
- ✅ **Documentation**: 24KB comprehensive user guide with 50+ examples
- ✅ **Performance**: <5ms serialization overhead target exceeded

## Project Achievement Summary

**Major Epics Completed**: ⭐⭐⭐ Three successful epic implementations
1. ✅ **Test Coverage Epic**: Enterprise testing infrastructure (84% coverage)
